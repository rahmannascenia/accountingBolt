## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- **Git:** You can download and install Git from the official website: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Node.js:** You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm:** npm is included with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

You'll also need to create a Supabase project and set up the database schema. You can find the database schema in the `supabase/migrations` directory.

Once you've created your Supabase project, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

You can then clone the repository, install the project dependencies, and start the development server:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:5173`.
